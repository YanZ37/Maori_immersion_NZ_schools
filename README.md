📘 Overview
This project explores patterns, relationships, and trends in Māori language immersion education across New Zealand schools from 2010 to 2024. Using statistical and visual analyses, it examines how socio-economic status, ethnicity, and regional characteristics influence participation in Māori language immersion programmes.

The aim is to generate data-driven insights that support equitable language policy and educational planning.

🎯 Objectives
Analyse national and regional student enrolment trends in Māori language immersion.
Examine how school decile, ethnicity, and region relate to immersion participation.
Apply clustering, regression, and correlation analyses to identify key patterns.
Present findings through interactive visualisations and dashboards.

📊 Key Findings
Socio-economic status and ethnicity strongly influence Māori immersion participation.
High-decile, European/Pākehā-dominant schools show low Māori immersion rates.
Low-decile, Māori-majority schools demonstrate strong engagement in Level 1 (high-immersion) programmes.
Bay of Plenty region maintains high immersion levels, while Auckland shows gradual improvement.

Regression results:
European/Pākehā (%) → explains 56 % of variance in Immersion None ( R² = 0.546 ).
Māori (%) → explains 22 % of variance ( R² = 0.223 ).

🧭 Interpretation & Implications
Participation in Māori language education remains uneven, shaped by demographic and socio-economic factors. Expanding access and awareness in high-decile and urban schools can promote more balanced national engagement with te reo Māori.

🧩 Recommendations
Expand Māori-medium options in high-decile schools.
Strengthen iwi–school partnerships to support te reo Māori.
Provide teacher training for Māori-medium delivery.
Monitor participation by region and decile to ensure equity.
